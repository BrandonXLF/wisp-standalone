# Waterloo Integrated Schedule Planner

The **Waterloo Integrated Schedule Planner** (**WISP**) allows you, assuming you are a student attending the University of Waterloo, to create and design your class schedule. It allows you to see how your various courses fit together and alert you if any conflicts arise. The tool uses live data directly from the UW website.

A live version of WISP is available at <https://www.brandonfowler.me/wisp/>.

## Running

The WISP project is built using Node.js, so make sure it is installed and set up properly. With Node.js installed, run `npm install` and then `npm run dev` to launch the development version of the project. To make a releasable build, run `npm run build`.
